<h2> Inglewood's Newest Team: The Los Angeles Clippers </h2>
    <p>The Clippers are certainly nothing new when it comes to playing in the NBA. However, thanks to owner Steve Balmer and his deep pockets, the Clippers have built their innovative new arena smack-dab in the middle of Inglewood, a project worth multiple billions of dollars. It's a giant step for a franchise that has come from a tumultuous past and is looking to build on recent success.</p>
    <h2>Out with the Old, In with the New</h2>

    <p>The Clippers came to Los Angeles in 1984, having originated from Buffalo and San Diego; they looked to make a mark in a city dominated by the big brother Lakers. However, rough times ensued as the Clippers enjoyed minimal playoff success for several seasons and well into the turn of the 21st century. The daunting shadow of previous owner Donald Sterling was a significant reason for these struggles.</p>
    <p>In 2013, Donald Sterling came under fire due to obscene remarks, and this led to the NBA forcing the sale of the Clippers to Steve Balmer. The Clippers had a revitalizing team which included No. 1 pick Blake Griffin, the point-god Chris Paul, and high-flyer DeAndre Jordan. While this team did not reach the ultimate goal of a championship, they created momentum for a team looking to overhaul its entire culture. The arrival of Paul George and Kawhi Leonard in 2019 would continue this elevated standard for success for a team that had now seen the playoffs in 13 out of the last 15 seasons, as well as 14 straight winning seasons.</p>
